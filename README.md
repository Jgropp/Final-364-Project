# Final-364-Project

Source: https://youtu.be/eu0tg4vgFr4

I created an app where you can see some crime statistics in michigan throughout the years. You need to sign up with a username and a password, which get stored in a database, and then you can see some very interesting statistics such as homicide numbers and population. I originally intended for this to be an interactive platform where the user could type in a zipcode and then see the crime in that area. I soon realized after many attempts that the API would not allow for this, and by the time I realized this, it was too late to pivot or use a different API. I still hope you enjoy!

Things needed to run this API is Flask and SQLITE3.

The signup page is a little bit confusing. You need to click the blue button that says sign up and then type in a username and password. After this you click the grey pop out button that says signup as well, which will take you to another screen. On this screen you click the blue button that says SignIn, then type in your credentials and finally press the grey button that says Login to bring you to the homescreen.
